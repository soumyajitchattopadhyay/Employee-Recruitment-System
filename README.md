## Build & Run Instructions

When you build the project in NetBeans, the IDE copies all the required JAR files on the classpath to the `dist/lib` folder. It also updates the application JAR's manifest file (`MANIFEST.MF`) with the correct Class-Path entries.

### To run the application from the command line:
1. Navigate to the `dist` folder.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
java -jar Employee.jar
```

### To distribute the project:
- Zip up the entire `dist` folder (including the `lib` folder).
- Share the zipped folder with the `Employee.jar` and all required libraries.

### Notes:
- If multiple JAR files have the same name on the classpath, only the first one is copied to the `lib` folder.
- Only JAR files are copied; other file types or folders on the classpath are not included.
- If a library's manifest includes a Class-Path element, ensure the referenced paths are available at runtime.
- To set or change the main class in NetBeans:
- Right-click the project in the Projects window.
- Select **Properties** â†’ **Run**.
- Enter the fully qualified main class name in the **Main Class** field.
